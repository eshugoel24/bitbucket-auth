# Bitbucket browser client app

This folder will contain a full in-browser client app that can authenticate with Bitbucket authorization server via OAuth2 using the implicit grant type flow.

The client will be modelled on the generic browser client app, available under `/client/generic/browser` in this project.

## Status

For now we have simply copied over the generic client. This needs to be split up into smaller files, functions, classes etc. Use modern ES6 javascript and possibly built and compiled using webpack with babel.

Please help make this happen!
